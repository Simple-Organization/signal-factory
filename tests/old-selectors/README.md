# Old signals/atoms

That part we are keeping old designs of `atoms` and `selectors` used to make tests, experiments and benchmarks

## Old selectors

They was created before the `new selector` api came out, but we keep them here for tests and experiments

The `new selector` must use `signalFactory` to create its internal state

And it need to have all functionalities as the previous `selectors`

And it must use the `get()` pattern like `jotai` or `recoil`
